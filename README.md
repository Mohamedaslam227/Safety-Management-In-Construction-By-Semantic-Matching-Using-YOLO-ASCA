# YOLO-ASCA: A Rule-Based Framework for Identifying Safety Risks in Construction Management
 A deep learning-based safety monitoring system for construction sites, integrating YOLO-ESCA for object detection and a Cross Attention Network for semantic alignment with safety rules. The system detects unsafe behaviors, evaluates compliance in real-time, and reduces accidents through advanced image-text matching.
